				The Plan
			</h1>
			<p id="note">
			For 2014-2015, the plan is to improve upon the infrastructure that's in place for TMT to make our program better. And I don't just mean in terms of winning more ballots - at least, directly. That also means improving the way we work with each other, working to make sure new members feel like they're a part of TMT right off the bat, improving communication, making sure that every member's voice is heard, and, ultimately, making sure that mock trial is <span>fun</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
			So here's the plan to get stuff done and make the program better!
			</p>

						<div class="panel-body ">
							In the middle of the fall, every member of TMT was required to fill out an anonymous captain evaluation to both give the captains ideas about where they could improve and to give Brian and me an idea of how each captain was doing and if there were any internal issues we needed to know about.

					</div>
					<div id="panel-element-2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						<div class="panel-body ">
							At the beginning of the year, Brian and I completely revamped the traditionally very boring Rules of Evidence Meeting to start off as an early version of what will hopefully become a “Boot Camp” for new members. This gave all the new members of the program the opportunity to meet each other, work with each other, and learn the rules of evidence without the pressure of trying to impress older members who already know many of the rules.

						<div class="panel-body ">
							Last year, a lot of people said that, as freshmen, they felt disconnected from the program, and felt intimidated going to their captains with problems. This year, I piloted the Mentor Program to start to combat that. This paired each new member with some older, more experienced member, who in theory could help answer questions, show the new member the ropes of being a part of TMT, and even adjust to college life. Many of our new members this year said that it did help them initially feel like they were a part of mock trial at the beginning of the year. As you’ll see in the <a href=“plan.html”> plan </a>, I’m want to make the mentor program a truly strong part of TMT’s infrastructure this year by ramping it up.

						<div class="panel-body ">
							This year, we made an effort to try to set up earlier scrimmages between teams, especially during the invitational season, so that teams and captains could see where the weak spots in their team or case theory is earlier than the week before competition, giving them the ability to make major changes after receiving feedback.

							Together with Sam and Sara, we were able to make improvements to Mumbo Jumbo. Ballots and pairings were out of the tab room in record time, all of TMT helped set up and run Mumbo in some way, rankings and awards were calculated via computer program, and the tournament was one of the most competitive in our region.

						<div class="panel-body ">
							Especially in second semester, rounds and scrimmages were recorded, which, for those teams that recorded their rounds, gave mockers the ability to judge themselves, find places to improve, and better assess their own abilities. Next year, I'd like to ramp this up too.

						<div class="panel-body ">
							Ballots have all been entered into excel spreadsheets by captains, allowing both captains and the co-presidents to quickly see how everyone scored for all rounds, and run some simple statistics to see where a team needs to improve and how to help.
