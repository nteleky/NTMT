				The Plan
			</h1>
			<p id="note">
			For 2014-2015, the plan is to improve upon the infrastructure that's in place for TMT to make our program better. And I don't just mean in terms of winning more ballots - at least, directly. That also means improving the way we work with each other, working to make sure new members feel like they're a part of TMT right off the bat, improving communication, making sure that every member's voice is heard, and, ultimately, making sure that mock trial is <span>fun</span>.
			</p>
			<p> Nope, these aren't just 'campaign promises.' <a href="experience.html">See what happened last time I published my plan to everyone (bottom of the linked page). </a></p>
			<p>
			So here's the plan to get stuff done and make the program better!
			</p>

					<div id="panel-element-1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
						<div class="panel-body ">
							This year, I piloted the Mentoring Program, to see if it would work to make new members feel like members of our mock trial community. The concept worked. Next year, I want to improve the program to make it a part of TMT's Infrastructure by:
							<ul>
								<li>Reassessing how to pair new members with upperclassmen to make sure the two are, at least, most likely compatible. </li>
								<li> Requiring mentors to check-in with their mentees every couple of weeks. </li>
								<li> Making it clearer that new members can go to their mentors for help with anything, from mock trial needs to adjusting to life at Tufts. </li>
							</ul>

					</div>
					<div id="panel-element-2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						<div class="panel-body ">
							This year, Brian and I worked to revamp the Rules of Evidence Meeting to make it more relevant to both new and old members alike. But one of the problems we still ran into was that some new members didn't feel like they learned as much as they should've first semester. Consistency regarding how things were taught to new members was a problem. And for many, it took some time before new members even understood what mock trial was all about. This year, I want to expand on the New Member Bootcamp idea by running Bootcamp each night after new members are accepted into the program, and then doing the following things:
							<ul>
								<li>Bring in different upperclassmen each night to talk about a different aspect of mock trial, from directs to witnessing to objections.  </li>
								<li> Having all the new members watch a NCT Final Round together early, so that everyone can be on the same page about what mock trial is and expectations </li>
								<li> Time is a concern here. The key to making this work would be getting different older members to help out each night, so that the time is spread among everyone in the program.</li>
								<li>A sample timeline: <ul>
									<li> Monday Night: Watch NCT Final Round </li>
									<li> Tuesday Night: Rules of Evidence </li>
									<li> Wednesday Night: First Team Meeting </li>
									<li> Thursday Night: Directs (flow and witnessing) </li>
									<li> Friday Night: Crosses (leading questions and witnessing) </li>
								</ul></li>
							</ul>

						<div class="panel-body ">
							After negotiating with the Senate, we have the ability to request supplemental funding to do a tournament across the country. Doing this would:
							<ul>
							<li> Give us the opportunity to see west coast schools in action, and start to work with their style.</li>
							<li> Help us build relationships with more programs across the country. </li>
							<li> Be a ton of fun. </li>
							</ul>
							<p> We shouldn't just do the west coast though. We should start to travel everywhere, from the South to the Midwest, to get a better feel for many of the different styles of mock trial. This year, for example, it would be worth looking into the possibility of an invitational in Ohio, since Nationals is in Cincinnati. </p>
							The last step necessary to make this a reality is building our fundraising infrastructure... see below.

						<div class="panel-body ">
							Captains are the foundation of our program. Someone's entire mock trial experience can be shaped by their captains. In an effort to make this experience even more positive and to help captains feel more supported by the CoPresidents, we should implement some form of captain training. <ul>
							<li> This could just be a few hours where captains and Co-Presidents talk in depth about issues that typically come up. </li>
							<li> Some topicsinclude: <ul> <li> Helping struggling members </li> <li> What to do when someone is skipping practice </li> <li> Team Building </li> <li> Coaching attorneys/witnesses</li> <li> Tournaments </li> </ul></li>

					<div id="panel-element-5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						<div class="panel-body ">
							This year, we've been sure to enter in all ballots into excel spreadsheets. The next step is conserving comments, if they ever become necessary. An easy way to do that is to scan ballots in and have a database of PDF files, so that Co Presidents, Captains, and members can look at ballots from any point in the year to better help their team improve.

						<div class="panel-body ">
							This is an area where TMT could really improve. We typically are able to get a sponsor for Mumbo Jumbo, but we should commit to building a fundraising infrastructure this year so that we can raise money to do things like:
							<ul> 
							<li> Reduce dues/member contributions to tournaments </li>
							<li> Go to tournaments all across the nation </li>
							<li> Get classy equipment (like nicer report covers, better demos, etc) </li>
							</ul>
							I'd work closely with the person elected Fundraising Director to make sure that we put a practical plan in place so that we can raise  money throughout the year, perhaps in the following ways:
							<ul>
							<li> More sponsors/sell ads for Mumbo Jumbo </li>
							<li> Get law firms/other businesses to sponsor TMT to go to invitationals. </li>
							<li> Work on Alumni Relations to get donations </li>
							</ul>

					</div>
					<div id="panel-element-7" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						<div class="panel-body ">
							This year, we've made huge strides to increase the transparency of the decision making processes of the Co-Presidents. If at any point, a member had a question about his/her stacking or another decision that was made and s/he asked about it, that member was given a real explanation as to the thought behind the decision, as opposed to some standard, BS-type lines. I'm committed to continuing to increase that transparency, especially when it comes to issues of stacking. With regard to stacking, when a decision is made, the response should directly relate to what went in to making that decision,  why it was made, and what that member can do to improve/what we're looking for. In that way, each individual member can be more invested in the program and better understand how to improve him/herself.
