				<h3>
					Hey TMT!
				</h3>
				<p>
					In a couple of hours, you’re going to be asked to sit in a room and vote for positions again. When you are, I want you to take a look around and see what I’ve done when I run to be your <span>co-president</span> again. This week, there has been a lot of campaigning. But I haven’t been campaigning with bumper stickers or buttons or yard signs and I didn’t start this week. I’ve been campaigning for the last seven months as your co-president.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I made this website last year, I meant for it to be more than just a list of ideas that I wanted to turn into goals. We make a lot of promises at elections. I made this site so you could hold me to the promises I made when you elected me. <a href="http://nteleky.github.io/NTMT13">I’m linking it now so you can see all the things I said I would accomplish this time last year.</a> I put it up so you could see that everything I said I would do, <span>I’ve done</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the last seven months, I’ve become familiar with how things work — what’s reasonable, what’s achievable, and what’s practical for us as mockers and as students. This year wasn't perfect - there are still a lot of problems to be solved. <span> We can do better. </span> Moving forward, I’m going to continue to try to solve the problems facing our program with <span>practical solutions</span>. Below, you can see my vision for next year. You’re not going to see ideas — you’re going to see plans. Because what I’ve learned this year is that plans are better than ideas. Plans are <span>real</span>. Plans are what can improve this club. Plans are what can help our program grow, help our people succeed, help us make next year our best ever. 
				</p>

				Experience
			</h2>
			<p>
				You want a Co-President with experience. The Co-President has to do a lot of "stuff:" getting money from the TCU Senate, building relationships with other programs, picking the invitationals we go to, stacking, helping out with Mumbo Jumbo, and more. Throughout this year, I've worked hard to help make our program better.

			<h2>
				Vision
			</h2>
			<p>
				You want a Co-President with a vision. In a nutshell? I want Tufts Mock Trial to become truly elite. This year, we broke the glass ceiling of student-run programs by taking ballots off the best teams in the country. Next year, I want to smash it.  But I want to do this without sacrificing the most important part: having fun.

			<h2>
				Plan
			</h2>
			<p>
				You want a Co-President with a plan. Plans are better than ideas, because they're realistic, practical, and achievable. A plan needs to solve the problems that face our club by 
				providing practical solutions. Revamping the Mentorship Program, competing all over the country during invitationals, training captains, and building a fundraising network are just a few things I want to work on.
