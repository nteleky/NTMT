				Experience
			</h1>
			<p>
			The Co-Presidents are responsible for helping the entire program succeed and function. In order to make sure things are done and done properly, you want a Co-President that has experience working with the Senate to get money, stacking, discussing decisions with members, picking invitationals, working with teams, and following through on those pesky "campaign promises." Throughout this year, I've shown I have that experience.
			</p>


			<h3> Money money money
			</h3>
			<p>
			I acted as one of the signatories for the club, meaning it was my job to work with the Senate to make sure we were funded throughout the year. Before Nationals, I worked with the TCU Treasurer and the entire Allocations Board to get us $10,000 to go to Nationals in Orlando, FL. During our budgeting meeting, I negotiated with our Council Chair to increase our budget by $5,000, giving us the money we need to attend better invitationals across the country for this upcoming year.
			</p>

			<h3> Stacking
			</h3>
			<p>
Stacking is delicate work. You need to be able to balance available roles, members, case theories, desires, team cohesion, and many more subtle factors all at once. There are a lot of things that go into play with stacking, but the important experience here is that you want someone who knows how to:
<ul>
<li>Lead a team</li>
<li>Analyze and pick good case strategies</li>
<li>Understand what differentiates “good” mock trial from “bad” mock trial</li>
<li>Be able to coach attorneys and witnesses (to help others do that)</li>
<li>See and evaluate where each member of the program is in terms of abilities</li>
</ul>
I have that experience. Over the last couple years I’ve:
<ul>
 <li>Co-captained and been a part of invitationals teams that placed at Brandeis, Penn State, Yale, and Boston College.</li>
 <li>Co-captained the C-Team in 2013 and managed to get a bid at the Manchester Regional after just two weeks of practice. We were the first C team in TMT history to get a bid out of regionals.</li>
 <li>Co-captained the A-Team this year, and earned a bid to ORCS, and then earned a bid to the National Championship Tournament for the 5th consecutive year.</li>
 <li>Went to Nationals and hit some of the best teams in the country, including Miami University (OH) A and UVA A, managed to take ballots off them, but more importantly saw different styles and forms of mock trial to see how our program can improve as a whole.</li>
 <li>Seen every member of Tufts Mock Trial perform multiple roles in mock trial, by going to tournaments (even when not competing), taking time to judge scrimmages, helped other teams (other than my own) and individuals during practices, and overall made a huge effort to see everyone work to see how to help each member improve and get better.</li>
 </ul>

 Furthermore, I uniquely have the experience of being a member on every level of the program. I've been on the A team as a member, observer, and captain, the B team as a member, and C teams as a member and captain. In explaining decisions, I can and have used that experience on each level of the program so that every member, if they ask, understands why they were placed where they were placed and what they can do to improve. That's important too.

<h3> Campaign Promises -- Debunked </h3>
			<p>
				Last year, <a href="images/Last-years-plan.jpg">I had a list of things I said I would do</a>, and I put them up on a similar website. I developed that list by talking to each member of the program, getting their ideas and their goals for the program, and turning them into plans. Let’s go through each one:

					</div>
					<div id="panel-element-1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
						<div class="panel-body alert-success">
							In the middle of the fall, every member of TMT was required to fill out an anonymous captain evaluation to both give the captains ideas about where they could improve and to give Brian and me an idea of how each captain was doing and if there were any internal issues we needed to know about.

					</div>
					<div id="panel-element-2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						<div class="panel-body alert-success">
							At the beginning of the year, Brian and I completely revamped the traditionally very boring Rules of Evidence Meeting to start off as an early version of what will hopefully become a “Boot Camp” for new members. This gave all the new members of the program the opportunity to meet each other, work with each other, and learn the rules of evidence without the pressure of trying to impress older members who already know many of the rules.

					</div>
					<div id="panel-element-3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						<div class="panel-body alert-success">
							Last year, a lot of people said that, as freshmen, they felt disconnected from the program, and felt intimidated going to their captains with problems. This year, I piloted the Mentor Program to start to combat that. This paired each new member with some older, more experienced member, who in theory could help answer questions, show the new member the ropes of being a part of TMT, and even adjust to college life. Many of our new members this year said that it did help them initially feel like they were a part of mock trial at the beginning of the year. As you’ll see in the <a href=“plan.html”> plan </a>, I’m want to make the mentor program a truly strong part of TMT’s infrastructure this year by ramping it up.

					<div id="panel-element-4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						<div class="panel-body alert-success">
							This year, we made an effort to try to set up earlier scrimmages between teams, especially during the invitational season, so that teams and captains could see where the weak spots in their team or case theory is earlier than the week before competition, giving them the ability to make major changes after receiving feedback.

							Together with Sam and Sara, we were able to make improvements to Mumbo Jumbo. Ballots and pairings were out of the tab room in record time, all of TMT helped set up and run Mumbo in some way, rankings and awards were calculated via computer program, and the tournament was one of the most competitive in our region.

						<div class="panel-body alert-success">
							Especially in second semester, rounds and scrimmages were recorded, which, for those teams that recorded their rounds, gave mockers the ability to judge themselves, find places to improve, and better assess their own abilities. Next year, I'd like to ramp this up too.

							Last year, I said I'd develop a plan to go to a west coast tournament (Like Beach Party or UCLAssic) in 2014-2015. That happened - the Allocations Board of the Senate agreed to consider a supplemental funding request next Fall if we want to go to a tournament on the west coast, given that we can fundraise some of the money to help out. Now that the plan is in place, we should do it!
