<h2>Vision</h2>
         <p>This year, TMT hit UVA A, widely regarded as one of the best mock trial teams in the entire country. We lost by 1/140 points on two ballots. We hit Miami University A, and split, winning a ballot by double digits. These were teams that any normal team would be terrified to hit. And we were competitive with them. We're at their level. My vision for our program is to take it to the next level and  truly become elite, but without sacrificing
         the most important part: having fun.
         </p>
         <h3>Why does fun matter? What about just 'winning'?</h3>
         <p>
            We didn't join Tufts Mock Trial because we wanted to win stuff - we've
            only recently become one of the best schools in our area. When we 
            decided to try-out, it was because of all the hundreds of options we
            were given at the Activities Fair, mock trial seemed like something that
            would be fulfilling and, ultimately, be fun. We pay 50k-60k to be here
            at this school per year and get the many opportunities this school provides.
            Why would you waste that money or that time to do something you don't
            truly enjoy doing?<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            But that's not all; enjoying mock trial will make you better at mock
            trial. Thoughout my time on TMT, I've heard at least a dozen judges talk about
            how it was clear that one team was more relaxed, less stressed, and seemed
            to be enjoying themselves more. If you love doing mock trial and aren't
            constantly stressed, you'll come off in a round as more confident. It also
            helps your preparation: if you're enjoying mock trial, you will spend more
            time working on mock trial and get better at it. That benefits everyone
            (except for the team you're facing).
            </p>
        <h3>
            How are we gonna get there?
        </h3>
        <p>
            By not only talking about ideas we have, but also implementing common-sense,
            practical plans to make our program better.. I have a detailed
            plan
            to get us to a point where every member of the program is improving
            and feels valued from the moment that member gets accepted - things like
            Captain Training, a Mentor Program, better-timed scrimmages, and more.
            Check out <a href="plan.html">The Plan </a> for details!
